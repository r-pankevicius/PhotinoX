Lightweight **.NET wrapper** for building desktop applications with native OS WebViews:
- **Windows**: WebView2
- **macOS**: WKWebView
- **Linux**: WebKitGTK 4.1

PhotinoX is a maintained fork of Photino.NET positioned between Electron/Tauri-style WebView desktop runtimes and traditional .NET UI frameworks such as WPF, Avalonia, and .NET MAUI. It focuses on predictable cross-platform desktop behavior, native runtime stability, and a cleaner managed API surface.

## What is PhotinoX?

PhotinoX builds on the original Photino design: native desktop windows hosted by modern **Web UI technologies** (Blazor, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), without bundling a full Chromium runtime.  
It relies entirely on **OS-native WebView engines**, keeping apps small and efficient.

The core model is native-first: `PhotinoX.Native` owns the platform windowing and WebView integration, while the .NET layer exposes that native runtime through `PhotinoApplication`, `PhotinoDispatcher`, and `PhotinoWindow`.

## How PhotinoX differs from Photino.NET

Compared with the original Photino.NET managed API, PhotinoX introduces an explicit `PhotinoApplication` model, centralized UI-thread dispatching through `PhotinoDispatcher`, application-owned notifications, simplified window event names, native-driven window state tracking, and explicit application and window lifecycle APIs.

### Application model

`PhotinoApplication` is the explicit application lifetime object. Window creation, shutdown behavior, and UI-thread dispatching are coordinated through the application and its dispatcher instead of implicit global state. The native application tracks open windows as the source of truth, while `MainWindow` and the observable `Windows` collection expose the synchronized managed application state.

| Previous model                                                                 | New model                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PhotinoWindow.WaitForClose()` creates the window and starts the message loop. | `PhotinoApplication.Run(window)` owns application lifetime and message-loop execution.                                                                          |
| Window creation and message-loop state are controlled from `PhotinoWindow`.    | `PhotinoApplication.Run(window)` shows the main window; explicit window creation/showing is available through `PhotinoWindow.Show()`.                           |
| Window lifetime is centered around individual `PhotinoWindow` instances.       | `PhotinoApplication` tracks open windows through `MainWindow` and `Windows`.                                                                                    |
| `PhotinoWindow.Invoke(...)` dispatches through window-level invoke helpers.    | UI-thread dispatching is centralized through `PhotinoApplication.Dispatcher`, including `CheckAccess`, `Invoke`, `TryInvoke`, `BeginInvoke`, and `InvokeAsync`. |
| Notification display is tied to window-level APIs.                             | Notifications are exposed through `PhotinoApplication`, with application-level enabled state and notification events.                                           |
| Shutdown behavior is implicit around the native message loop.                  | Shutdown behavior is controlled by `PhotinoShutdownMode`, `PhotinoApplication.Shutdown(...)`, and `ShutdownRequested`.                                          |

Notable application lifecycle APIs:

| Area              | API                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lifecycle         | `Run`, `Shutdown`, `Startup`, `ShutdownRequested`, `Exit`                                    |
| Windows           | `MainWindow`, observable `Windows` collection                                                |
| Shutdown behavior | `ShutdownMode`, `ShutdownRequestedEventArgs`, `PhotinoShutdownRequestReason`                 |
| Notifications     | `ShowNotification`, `NotificationsEnabled`, notification activation/dismissal/failure events |

```csharp
var app = new PhotinoApplication();

var window = new PhotinoWindow()
    .SetTitle("PhotinoX")
    .Load("index.html")
    .RegisterClosingHandler((_, e) => e.Cancel = true);

return app.Run(window);
```

On Windows, `PhotinoApplication.Run()` performs native window initialization and runs the message loop on an STA thread when the calling thread is not an STA thread.

`PhotinoDispatcher` provides application-level UI-thread dispatching. `Invoke(...)` executes work on the dispatcher thread and throws when scheduling fails, while `TryInvoke(...)` returns `false` for scheduling failures. `BeginInvoke(...)` reports scheduling success as `bool`, and `InvokeAsync(...)` returns a task that completes when the dispatched callback completes, is canceled, or faults if scheduling fails. Cancellation-aware overloads accept `CancellationToken`, and async callback overloads use `ValueTask` / `ValueTask<TResult>` for allocation-friendly completion paths. State-based overloads are available to avoid closure captures.

`ShutdownRequested` is raised for cancellable shutdown requests. `ShutdownRequestedEventArgs.Reason` identifies application requests, Windows session logoff, Windows system shutdown/restart, or an unknown platform shutdown source. Canceling Windows session shutdown requests may prevent logoff or system shutdown.

`PhotinoApplication` also owns native notification integration. Notifications are shown through the application surface instead of individual windows, with enable/disable state, optional user state, and notification events for activation, action activation, input activation, dismissal, and asynchronous failure.

`ShowNotification(...)` returns a positive notification identifier when the request is accepted. It returns `0` when the notification is skipped by policy or application state, `-1` for invalid or untracked requests, `-2` when native notification backend initialization fails, and `-3` when native notification display fails synchronously.

`PhotinoApplication.GetRuntimeInfo()` exposes runtime diagnostics for the current application process, including OS, .NET, PhotinoX native version, WebView engine, WebView runtime version, and platform-specific runtime details. See [Samples/RuntimeDiagnostics](https://github.com/ivanvoyager/PhotinoX/tree/master/Samples/RuntimeDiagnostics) for a minimal diagnostics sample.

### Window events

Window event names are simplified to remove redundant `Window` prefixes and align better with common .NET event naming. Closing now uses standard `CancelEventArgs`, focus events are exposed as `Activated` and `Deactivated`, and window state events are driven by actual native state transitions instead of transient resize messages.

| Photino.NET API         | New API                |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `WindowCreating`        | `Creating`             |
| `WindowCreated`         | `Created`              |
| `WindowClosing`         | `Closing`              |
| -                       | `Closed`               |
| `WindowLocationChanged` | `LocationChanged`      |
| `WindowSizeChanged`     | `SizeChanged`          |
| `WindowFocusIn`         | `Activated`            |
| `WindowFocusOut`        | `Deactivated`          |
| `WindowMaximized`       | `Maximized`            |
| `WindowRestored`        | `Restored`             |
| `WindowMinimized`       | `Minimized`            |
| -                       | `FullScreenEntered`    |
| -                       | `FullScreenExited`     |
| -                       | `StateChanged`         |
| -                       | `NavigationStarting`   |
| -                       | `NewWindowRequested`   |
| -                       | `ContentLoading`       |
| -                       | `ContentLoaded`        |
| -                       | `InitialContentLoaded` |

`Closing` now uses `EventHandler<CancelEventArgs>`; set `CancelEventArgs.Cancel` to cancel the close operation.

`LocationChanged`, `SizeChanged`, and `WebMessageReceived` now use strongly typed event payload records instead of raw `Point`, `Size`, and `string` values. `WebMessageReceivedEventArgs` includes both the message and the top-level WebView URI at the time the message was received.

`NavigationStarting` is raised before the WebView starts navigating to top-level content. Set `NavigationStartingEventArgs.Cancel` to cancel the current-window navigation.

`NewWindowRequested` is raised when WebView content requests opening content in a new window, such as through `target="_blank"` links or `window.open(...)`. PhotinoX does not create browser-controlled popup windows. Applications can handle this event and open the requested URI externally if needed.

`ContentLoading`, `ContentLoaded`, and `InitialContentLoaded` are available for observing top-level WebView content loading. `ContentLoading` is raised when top-level content starts loading after navigation has committed. `ContentLoaded` is raised after each completed top-level content load, while `InitialContentLoaded` is raised once after the initial top-level content load completes. These events do not indicate that a JavaScript framework, SPA route, Blazor component tree, or all asynchronous page work has finished rendering.

| -                                    | `RegisterClosedHandler(...)`               |
| -                                    | `RegisterFullScreenEnteredHandler(...)`    |
| -                                    | `RegisterFullScreenExitedHandler(...)`     |
| -                                    | `RegisterStateChangedHandler(...)`         |
| -                                    | `RegisterNavigationStartingHandler(...)`   |
| -                                    | `RegisterNewWindowRequestedHandler(...)`   |
| -                                    | `RegisterContentLoadingHandler(...)`       |
| -                                    | `RegisterContentLoadedHandler(...)`        |
| -                                    | `RegisterInitialContentLoadedHandler(...)` |

### Window API

`PhotinoWindow` now uses explicit `Show()`-based window creation, unified `WindowState` tracking, explicit lifecycle state, and simplified lifecycle events.

| Previous API                                          | New API / direction                                                                                                    |

| `WaitForClose()`                                      | `PhotinoApplication.Run(window)` for application startup; `PhotinoWindow.Show()` for explicit window creation/showing. |
| `LoadRawString(...)`                                  | `LoadString(...)`                                                                                                      |
| Windows-only `WindowHandle`                           | Platform-specific handle: `HWND`, `GtkWidget*`, or `NSWindow*`                                                         |
| No explicit closed state                              | `IsClosed`                                                                                                             |

| `SetTemporaryFilesPath(...)`                          | `SetUserDataFolder(...)`                                                                                               |

Notable window lifecycle and API changes in PhotinoX:

| Area                                      | API                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Window lifecycle                          | `Show`, `Activate`, `BringToFront`                                                                                                    |
| Window state model                        | `WindowState`, `StateChanged`                                                                                                         |
| Window state commands                     | `Maximize`, `Minimize`, `Restore`, `SetWindowState`                                                                                   |
| Existing state helpers                    | `SetFullScreen`, `SetMaximized`, `SetMinimized`                                                                                       |
| Chromeless window helpers                 | `BeginWindowDrag`, `BeginWindowResize`                                                                                                |
| Linux chromeless native hit-test settings | `SetLinuxChromelessDragRegion`, `SetLinuxChromelessDragRegions`, `SetLinuxChromelessResizeBorderThickness`, `LinuxChromelessSettings` |
| Window/platform state                     | `IsInitialized`, `IsClosed`, cross-platform `WindowHandle`                                                                            |

`WindowState` replaces the previous `FullScreen`, `Maximized`, and `Minimized` properties with a single state model. It supports `Normal`, `Minimized`, `Maximized`, and `FullScreen`, and is also used for startup state configuration.

`MainMonitor` represents the monitor that currently contains the native window. `Monitors` enumerates all available monitors and does not define which monitor is considered current.

Window state tracking is native-driven: `StateChanged`, `Maximized`, `Minimized`, `Restored`, `FullScreenEntered`, and `FullScreenExited` are raised from actual state transitions, not from transient resize messages. This avoids duplicate or misleading `Restored` notifications during operations such as resizing or minimizing from fullscreen.

`Maximize()`, `Minimize()`, and `Restore()` are new command-style APIs. Existing helpers such as `SetFullScreen(...)`, `SetMaximized(...)`, and `SetMinimized(...)` remain available and update the same underlying native state.

Chromeless windows can use `BeginWindowDrag()` and `BeginWindowResize(...)` for custom title bar and resize implementations on Windows and macOS. On Linux, native chromeless drag and resize use GTK hit testing because Wayland requires the originating native pointer event.

Use `LinuxChromelessSettings` or `SetLinuxChromelessDragRegion(...)` to configure the initial drag region. `SetLinuxChromelessDragRegion(...)` can also replace the current drag region after native window initialization.

For dynamic or complex title bars, use `SetLinuxChromelessDragRegions(...)` to replace all drag and no-drag regions:

```csharp
window.SetLinuxChromelessDragRegions(
    dragRegions:
    [
        new LayoutRegion(
            width: 0,
            height: 44,
            horizontalAlignment: HorizontalAlignment.Stretch)
    ],
    noDragRegions:
    [
        new LayoutRegion(
            width: 120,
            height: 32,
            margin: new Thickness(left: 12, top: 6, right: 0, bottom: 0))
    ]);
```

No-drag regions take precedence over drag regions. Alignment and margins are resolved against the current WebView client area, allowing regions to adapt when the window is resized. Each call replaces all previously configured drag and no-drag regions.

Use `SetLinuxChromelessResizeBorderThickness(...)` to change the native resize border independently without replacing the current drag regions. These Linux-specific APIs are ignored on Windows and macOS.

### Custom schemes and startup content

Custom scheme registration is stricter and more predictable. Scheme names are validated, and reserved schemes such as `http`, `https`, and `file` are rejected.

Startup content selection is explicit: `Load(...)` sets URL content and clears raw string content, while `LoadString(...)` sets raw string content and clears URL content.

`Load(string)` treats only explicit URI strings such as `http://`, `https://`, `file://`, and registered custom schemes as URI navigation. Other strings are resolved as local file paths.

| Area | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `RegisterCustomSchemeHandler(...)` | Validates scheme names and rejects reserved schemes. |
| Managed custom scheme responses | Response data is backed by native-owned memory for safer managed/native interop. |
| `Load(...)` | Sets startup URL content and clears raw string content. |
| `LoadString(...)` | Sets raw string content and clears startup URL content. |

### WebView runtime behavior

On Windows, `UserDataFolder` specifies the WebView2 user data folder used by the WebView2 runtime. It is used for browser profile data such as cookies, permissions, cache, local storage, IndexedDB, and related WebView2 state.

`TemporaryFilesPath` and `SetTemporaryFilesPath(...)` were renamed to `UserDataFolder` and `SetUserDataFolder(...)` to match the actual WebView2 behavior.

PhotinoX reuses an existing WebView2 environment when the requested Windows WebView2 configuration is compatible with an environment that has already been created.

`StatusBarEnabled` controls the embedded WebView status bar where supported. On Windows, it maps to WebView2 `IsStatusBarEnabled` and can disable the bottom-left link hover URL overlay. On macOS and Linux, the option is stored but currently has no native effect.

### Compatibility

These changes may require source-level updates for applications that use older Photino.NET event names, `WaitForClose()`-based startup, focus-in/focus-out event handlers, old bool-returning close handlers, direct `Point` / `Size` / `string` event payloads, older `WebMessageReceived` handlers that only expected a message string, or the previous separate fullscreen/maximized/minimized state model now replaced by `WindowState`.

### Native runtime foundation

The managed API is built on the updated `PhotinoX.Native` runtime, including safer native memory ownership, clearer platform isolation, improved interop layout, an application-oriented message-loop and dispatch model, native notification integration, application window tracking, and unified window state handling.

On Windows, fullscreen is handled as a native restore-aware state transition: the previous window style and placement are preserved before entering fullscreen and restored when leaving fullscreen. Startup state is synchronized without raising user callbacks before window creation completes.

On Linux Wayland, top-level window position is compositor-controlled. Move notifications and position restore are best-effort; state and size tracking remain supported. Chromeless drag and resize use native GTK event-driven hit testing configured from the managed Linux chromeless settings.

## Build from source

```bash
dotnet restore Photino.NET/PhotinoX.csproj
dotnet build   Photino.NET/PhotinoX.csproj -c Release
dotnet pack    Photino.NET/PhotinoX.csproj -c Release -o artifacts
```
> CI: see [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](https://github.com/ivanvoyager/PhotinoX/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) (build + pack + upload `.nupkg`/`.snupkg`).

## Developing

You don't need to build for all target platforms to do everyday development or experiment with samples.
To use only `net10.0` create file `Directory.Build.local.props` in project root with the following content:
```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
	<!-- Local development: build a single TFM ($(LocalDevTargetFramework), default net10.0)
		 for a faster inner-loop. This file is git-ignored and per-developer.
		 Remove or set to false to build all supported frameworks locally. -->
	<LocalDev>true</LocalDev>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
